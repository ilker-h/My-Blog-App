## To Run the App

To run the app, create a terminal and write “ng serve” then create another terminal and write “npm run start:server”, then go to a browser and go to the URL “localhost:4200”.

If there is still a problem, log into MongoDB and go to the Security>Network Access>IP Whitelist and add your IP address.
